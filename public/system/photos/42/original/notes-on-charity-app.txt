Events don't send or receive messages (they can send an updates/invites but that goes to an email address; has nothing to do with msg inbox). With that in mind, we don't *need* an inbox; we can already send updates and invitations

Messages then would only go between profiles (either organizations, partners, (donors?))

Leaving it out would save a lot of work, but what is gained by adding it?
1) Right now billies have no way to invite other billies unless they have their email address
2) Billies might want to send messages to donors, billies, or organizations not in their network
3) Organizations might want to send messages to donors, billies, or organizations not in their network
4) Donors might want to send messages to donors, billies, or organizations not in their network

Questions that might/probably will matter:
1) How will organizations send invites? Same as billies? Then they will need an email address. 
2) What about billies receiving invites? Will those just hit their email address? Or will they happen within the app (right now they have an invites tab no their profile page?)
3) Also how would billies send invites to other billies?

Is there a difference between an invite to donate and an invite to become a partner?

comments - public, anyone can make a comment, billy gets alert to gmail
call to action - internal, billies invite other billies, organizations invite other billies
